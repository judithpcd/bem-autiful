                Today has been a cold and wet day, with rain intermittent throughout. Itâ€™s just the type of weather that calls for a piping-hot pot sinigang na baboy,
                which was exactly what I prepared for lunch. Thick with the sourness of tamarind and abundant with crisp-tender vegetables and succulent meat chunks,
                my steaming bowl provided much-needed comfort against the malevolent weather outside.

              <h3>Instructions:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Wash pork ribs. In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming off scum that accumulates on top. Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onions and fish sauce.
                  Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 10 cups.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add gabi and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until soft. Add chili and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.
                  Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes. Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add into pot and stir until completely dissolved. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
